# Restaurant_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
Bernouilli Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm to predict whether a review is positive or negative

The dataset has been made such that each feature is a categorical feature (0, 1) representing the presence
or absence of words used in restaurant reviews. Common words such as "the", "a" etc... are not categorized.

Each row represents a single point (restaurant review) and each column its features (presence or not of 
words used in reviews). Each column is an individual feature apart from the last column which contains
the labels, whether a review is positive (1) or negative (0).

The model predicts the right label with an accuracy of ~83%
